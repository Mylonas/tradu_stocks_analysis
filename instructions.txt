Task Overview

In this task, you will receive a CSV file containing a dataset. 
You aim to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset and present your findings. 
This task will help us evaluate your ability to analyze data, identify key insights, and  
communicate your results using visualizations.

Dataset Description

The dataset represents an average spread per hour for two financial instruments across multiple days. 
Spread is the difference between the ask price (buy) and the bid price (sell).

There are three columns in the dataset:
- quote_hour: UTC timestamp when the data was recorded.
- symbol: The symbol representing a financial instrument.
- avg_spread: The average spread for the given hour and symbol.
 
Deliverables

Please submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) containing your entire analysis, including code, visualizations 
and written explanations for the steps. 
Make sure all cells in the notebook are executed and the outputs are saved in the notebook. 
Provide explanations for the steps that you went through and a summary of your key findings with some charts to support them. 
Highlight any interesting patterns, trends, or anomalies you discovered. Finally, please advise us on 
what alert we can set up for this data to spot changes in the spreads.
